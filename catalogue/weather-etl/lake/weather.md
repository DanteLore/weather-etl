# lake.weather — Deduplicated Met Office Hourly Observations

## Description

Cleaned and deduplicated hourly weather observations from 137 UK and Ireland Met Office surface stations. This is the main analysis table. Derived from [`incoming.weather`](../incoming/weather.md) by removing duplicates within each station-hour and filtering out a known run of bad readings from Chivenor. Covers wind speed, wind direction, temperature, dew point, pressure, humidity, visibility, and weather type.

## Classification

Public. Derived from Met Office public data; no personal data.

## Owner

## Source ETL / code

[`github.com/dantelore/weather-etl`](https://github.com/dantelore/weather-etl), `weather_data_model/lambda_function.py`. Lambda function `model_weather_data`.

The rebuild SQL deduplicates using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY date_trunc('hour', observation_ts), site_id ORDER BY observation_ts DESC)` — keeping the latest observation within each station-hour. It also excludes Chivenor readings below −5°C in July 2022.

## Freshness & update cadence

Full table rebuild every night at 06:00 UTC by the `model_weather_data` Lambda (`cron(0 6 * * ? *)`). The entire Parquet dataset is deleted and rewritten from `incoming.weather` on each run. Data is typically complete and current by ~06:05 UTC each morning.

Because the rebuild reads all of `incoming.weather` every time, corrections to past incoming data will automatically propagate without any manual intervention.

## Known issues & caveats

- CHIVENOR July 2022: a run of implausible sub-−5°C readings is hard-filtered out in the rebuild SQL. The raw data is still present in `incoming.weather` if you need it.
- Deduplication keeps the *latest* observation timestamp within each station-hour, not the first. In practice the difference is negligible but worth knowing if timestamp precision matters.
- The table is fully deleted and rebuilt nightly, so any Athena query running against it around 06:00 UTC may see an empty or partial result. Queries should be scheduled to run after the rebuild completes.
